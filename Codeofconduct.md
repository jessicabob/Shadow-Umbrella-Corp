## How to treat each other

* Be respectful and value each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints.
* Be direct but professional; we cannot withhold hard truths.
* Be inclusive and help new perspectives be heard.
* Appreciate and accommodate our many cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs.
* Be open to learning from others.
* Lead by example and match your actions with your words.

## Inclusion and Diversity

The Shadow Umbrella Corp welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. It doesn’t matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you.

We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community, including, but not limited to people of varied age, culture, ethnicity, gender, gender-identity, language, race, sexual orientation, geographical location and religious views.
Shadow Umbrella Corp activities should be inclusive and should support such diversity.

The Shadow Umbrella Corp organisers reserve the right to refuse admission to anyone violating these policies, and/or take further action including expulsion from the program.
