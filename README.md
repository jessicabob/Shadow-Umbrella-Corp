# Shadow-Umbrella-Corp
I am working with STEAM community builders and leaders to create a financial home for their inclusive, innovative, community-oriented events/projects/programs. I am working openly to access a larger knowledge base to make a sustainable entity that serves the growing needs of the Eugene-Springfield community.
