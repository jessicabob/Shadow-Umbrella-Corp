## What are we doing?

### The problem

* There is a lack of diversity in many grant applicant pools.
* Smaller community groups need a fiscal home for many grant applications.

Not having a fiscal sponsor to accept grant monies limits smaller community groups ability to apply and be awarded grants. Fewer groups feeling empowered to apply for sponsorship and grants creates less diversity in the grant applicant pool. Funds management and bookeeping can tax the available resources of small community-oriented events/projects/programs, making it harder to produce inclusive, innovative opportunities for the public.

### The solution

The Shadow-Umbrella-Corp will:

* Pool resources from STEAM community builders and leaders to create a financial home for their inclusive, innovative, community-oriented events/projects/programs.

* Discover whether it is better for the interested parties to attain Non-Profit status or to become a BCorp or some other entity that fits our Users needs better.

## Who are we?

We are EugeneTech, an enthusiastic group of STEAM community builders wanting to make the Eugene-Springfield area an inclusive and innovative hub of STEAM activity for all ages and demographics. We like to connect community groups with intersecting interests and goals that might not know about each other - to to build groups or events that are greater than the sum of their parts.

## What do we need?

**You**! In whatever way you can help.

We need expertise in bookkeeping, community building, non-profit creation, small business creation and legal advice surrounding both.

We'd love your feedback along the way, and of course, we'd love you to be a part of one of our programs or events once we build a finacial home.

Our primary goal is to create a financial home for local STEAM Community groups so they have a way to access their grant and sponsorship funds easily and transparently. A secondary goal is to support programming of ART-TECH-PLAY projects and helping other projects get activated.
